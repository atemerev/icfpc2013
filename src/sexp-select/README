Select parts of sexp using CSS-like selectors

Supported selectors are:
  [n]       - numbered element of the List
  *         - any element
  foo       - element named foo
  foo bar   - element named bar that is descendent of foo
  foo > bar - element named bar that is a child of foo

Usage:
    sexp-select 'selector expression' < file.sexp

For example, for sexp file that contains:
  (Foo ((unFoo 23) (getBar "42.0")))

selectors would be evaluated like that:

    '*'  ==> (Foo ((unFoo 23) (getBar "42.0"))
    
    '* > unFoo' ==> 23
    
    'Foo unFoo' ==> 23
    
    'Foo' ==> ((unFoo 23) (getBar "42.0")
    
    'Foo > *' ==> (unFoo 23)
                  (getBar "42.0")
